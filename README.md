# Car-Price-prediction

â€“ The price of a new car in the industry is fixed by the manufacturer with some additional costs incurred
by the Indian Government in the form of taxes. So, customers buying a brand-new vehicle may be confident of the
money they make investments to be worth. But, due to the increased prices of new cars and the financial incapability
of the customers to buy them, used Car sales are on a global increase. Therefore, to find the car price which would
be best suited for the buyer in India, we are going to predict its cost with the help of Machine Learning algorithms
which are made available by the Python Environment such as the Gradient Boosting algorithm. Our dataset
comprises data related to different car brands with a set of parameters (Name, Location, Year, Fuel Type,
Transmission, Owner Type, Mileage, Engine, Power, Seats, Price). The primary purpose is to design a model for a
given dataset and predict the car price with better accuracy.
